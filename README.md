Back to Earth!
==============


HOW TO PLAY:

Play this game by clicking the start button.  Left and Right arrows will move your hero LEFT and RIGHT.  SPACE will shoot a missile.  Pressing ENTER will turn on player invincibility.

This game is a verticle scroller spaceship shooter game, very similar to Galaga.  In this game, enemies (ships, aliens, etc) will scroll and move in fixed patterns down the screen as the hero (a spaceship) moves along the x axis at the bottom of the screen, shooting up to destroy the enemies while also avoiding them from hitting it. 

Be a hero!  Get back to Earth!   The lone hero trapped in deep space only has the help of his high-tech spaceship to destroy and avoid the enemies and get back home!

The goal of this game, in terms of its story, is to get back to Earth.  Advancing through levels will be based upon time elapsed, and if enough time elapses, it will result in winning the entire game.

The basic mechanics are as follows:  The hero will be scrolling left and right along an axis at the bottom of the screen.  The hero will be able to shoot missiles along a verticle axis directly up.  The enemies move in patterns coming down from the top of the screen.  Many enemies can be in the screen at once.  They will move along predefined patterns left and right with a constant movement towards the bottom of the screen where they may or may not come in contact with the hero along the bottom.

The game will have 5 levels.  With each level, the speed at which the enemies move down the screen will increase and the number of enemies will increase as well.  Additionally, the hero will be able to shoot faster (shorter delay periods between shots) as the levels advance.  Each level will last 45 seconds.  Once the hero has advanced through all 5 levels, the hero will "arrive home to Earth" and win the game.  
***Considering having a boss at the end of each level that is bigger and takes more shots to defeat, however not yet decided on this aspect of the game yet.
